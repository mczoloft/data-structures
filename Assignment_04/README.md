I've tried to sketch first the HTML structure and then compare it to my possible model, just as a way to understand their placement and movement between these 2 structures.

On the new model, I've tried to give each attribute their type, but I still have some doubts on some of them, in particular Dates and Hours.

Also tried to insert sub-objects inside the location attribute; one of them product of our data scraping, which should be precise and well-documented as to maintain a distance from the original model.
